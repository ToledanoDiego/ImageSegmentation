##### Description : #####

  This paragraph is the description of the method I have used. So firstly, my code has been
  inspired by the Otsu method which mean that I am calculating the mean intensity of the image in
  order to find the minimum variance between all pixels of the image. Then, I have used that
  mean value to threshold the image into a black and white one. Then, I have used the same
  Gabor function from the last week to find the edges of the image. After that, using the same
  mean value, I have converted the double image to a binary one. Finally, an erosion is applied to
  have a clear result.
